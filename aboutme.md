# WHO ARE YOU?

Hello guys, my name is Nakima S.D. Slaughter in I'm 16 years old. In I was born in Dallas,Texas.
I go to Franklin D. Roosevelt in I attend the Collegiate Academy.I wanted to be in the collegiate cause I think its a good thing and you can get ahead.
Before High School started for me my mom gave names of schools,I just said this school.
I go to the same school my parents went but my mom left in went to a school in North Dallas.
So I'm the youngest out of my mom kids in she just had two kids.
My daddy only had me in I'm happy with that because I can get all the things I want and I'm a daddy's baby too.
I do track in field but I always liked it, I did it when I was young in I had stop for like a year.
But yes I'm doing it now I go to practice the days I can if nothing else happen, also I be practicing with the cross country kids in I know he gone want me to run a meet most likely the last meet like last year.
I don't work but I cut yards on the weekends from time to time if its not raining.
To me I like cutting its fun to do, its easy that means when I have my own house I'm not gone need nobody to do my yard.
I'm a little scared of the weed eaters I'm going to end up knowing how to do it just not now.
Lastly, out of no where I told my parents I wanted to get braces in they let me get them on the 7th of September.
